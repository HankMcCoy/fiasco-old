# Fiasco Facilitator

This is a personal project for me to fiddle with RethinkDB and Socket.IO. The goal is to create a simple tool for helping people play Fiasco remotely. Perhaps someday I might use this as an opportunity to play around with WebRTC, but for now this tool will be intended to be used alongside something like Skype or Google Hangouts.
